### Hello
I'm Video. I do programming as a hobby. Most of my important projects relate to data handling or scraping.

#### Highlights
These are projects of mine that I'm proud of. Usually, it's because I've put a lot of effort into them or polished them.

| Project | Language | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| [**Hotbars+**](https://github.com/VideoGameSmash12/HotbarsPlus) | Java | Client mod for Minecraft 1.14.4 - 1.20.2 that expands the saved hotbar capacity to ludicrous amounts |
| [**OmegaTrack**](https://github.com/VideoGameSmash12/OmegaTrack) | Java | Fork of [hhhzzzsss's EpsilonBot](https://github.com/hhhzzzsss/EpsilonBot/) that tracks players' in-game coordinates on servers that provide operator permissions and sends them to a PostgreSQL server |
| [**rgrab**](https://github.com/VideoGameSmash12/rgrab) | Python | Script that scrapes Roblox clients from their setup servers |
| [**WNT**](https://github.com/VideoGameSmash12/WNT) | Java | Client utility mod for Minecraft 1.19.3 - 1.20.2 that provides a lot of tools that are helpful for those who are technically inclined |
